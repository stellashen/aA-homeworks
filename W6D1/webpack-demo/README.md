```

## Set the mode option
reference: https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-4-tutorial/#webpack_4_production_and_development_mode

"webpack 4 introduces production and development mode."

"In webpack 4 you can get by without a single line of configuration! Just define the --modeflag and you get everything for free!"

Add the following code to `package.json`:
```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "webpack --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

reference: https://scotch.io/tutorials/whats-new-in-webpack-4#the-mode-property
You can set your mode in the webpack.config.js file to either development or production.
```
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development'
}
```
## NPM Scripts
```sh
~/Dropbox/AA/aA-homeworks/W6D1/webpack-demo (master)$ npm run build

> webpack-demo@1.0.0 build /Users/sheny/Dropbox/AA/aA-homeworks/W6D1/webpack-demo
